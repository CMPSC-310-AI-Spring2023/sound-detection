## Arduino Project

Describe the application you have chosen to develop and provide a motivation for why it is a useful application. Include  references of all sources you have used throughout this project (URLs are sufficient).

We plan to create a arduino board application which will take sound as an input (talking/music), take an approximation of the frequency being recorded and then display a color based on the closest note heard. The different led's will be set to correspond to specific note frequencies.
## Agent

Explain the characteristics/attributes of your agent, what makes it an agent (within the discussed course content), what makes it rational, what type of an agent it is, and what is its environment task (PEAS).

It is an agent because it interacts with the outside world. this is due to its ability to record sound and display a corresponding color in response. This is rational behaviour because the output corresponds directly to the input.

Performance will be measured by its abiity to accurately show thew correct colors.

Environment is inteded to be recreational spaces such as homes or studios.

Agents will be the leds that display the various colors.

Sensing will be done through the microphone.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

TODO:

Discuss any challenges you have encountered during the work on this lab and  describe what have you learned. 

## Ethical Benefits and Implications

TODO:
In this section, drawing on class discussions and readings, answer the following questions

1. What entities, businesses, organizations do you envision developing the type of the application you have chosen to develop?

2. Who are the intended users of this technology?

3. Who is not supposed to use this technology?

4. How can the application developed in this lab cause harm?

5. What solutions could be implemented to avoid the harm or to fix the harm described above?

## Team Work

TODO:
Describe the details of your team working strategy, specifically explain how did you complete this work as a team and describe the specific contributions of each team member.
