# Sound Detection

## Arduino Project

We created a arduino board application which takes sound as an input (talking/music), takes an approximation of the frequency being recorded and then displays a color based on the closest note heard. The different LEDs are set to correspond to specific note frequencies. This idea functions similarly to a tuner, although we hope to be able to distinguish the notes regardless of the octave.

## Agent

It is an agent because it interacts with the outside world. this is due to its ability to record sound and display a corresponding color in response. This is rational behaviour because the output corresponds directly to the input.

PEAS:

Performance will be measured by its ability to accurately show thew correct colors.

Environment is intended to be used in recreational spaces such as homes or studios.

Agents are the LEDs that display the various colors.

Sensing is done through the microphone.
